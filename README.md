# smolgumball/nms-mods

Various mods for [No Mans Sky](https://www.gog.com/en/game/no_mans_sky) using [AMUMSS](https://github.com/MetaIdea/AMUMSS-nms-auto-modbuilder-updater-modscript-system) Lua scripts.

These Lua scripts use an API provided by AMUMSS to rewrite particular lines of `EXML` files, which are unpacked from core game as needed, and then repacked for use as mods.

Mods often break as game is updated or hotfixed. The Lua based mods, with the ability to continually target newer versions of the `MBINCompiler` used by AMUMSS, make compatibility updates more straight forward.

All mods provided as-is, and credit goes to original authors where applicable.
